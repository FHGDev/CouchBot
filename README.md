# CouchBot
CouchBot is a Discord Bot that allows you to announce when you, your friends, and anyone go live on Beam, Hitbox, Twitch, or YouTube Gaming. Also, create content on YouTube?! We'll announce that too!

Please note - The code behind CouchBot has been removed due to us getting granted access to some Beta APIs to improve speed and efficiency of our API calls. If/when these are ever made public again the code will be re-released!
